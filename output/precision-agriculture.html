        <div class="entry-content">
            <p>Precision agriculture, like most business prerogatives, is concerned with minimizing inputs while maximizing outputs. One high-cost input in agriculture is fertilizer, which has financial and environmental costs; not to mention an $82 million dollar per year cost to the seafood and tourism&nbsp;industries.</p>
<p>The hypoxic dead zone off the gulf-coast, devoid of any aquatic life, is attributed to a lack of oxygen due to the proliferation of algal blooms, which dominate in a nitrogen rich environment fueled by excess&nbsp;fertilizer. </p>
<p>To optimize and ensure crop yields, farmers hedge their bets by applying fertilizer to an extent to which all the biomass between the farm and the lake/river cannot fully absorb the runaway&nbsp;nitrogen.</p>
<p>Cascading excess nitrogen poses an opportunity for farmers to “piggyback” off of upstream nitrogen and spend less money on fertilizer. However, farmers have their livelihood at stake and cannot afford to make uneducated guesses as to where they can skim on&nbsp;fertilizer. </p>
<p>This is where machine learning comes into play. For my college thesis, I worked on a hydrological model called Soil and Water Assessment Tool (<span class="caps">SWAT</span>) in an ArcGIS environment to identify critical “sinks” and “sources” of accumulated nitrogen using topographic, geological, climate, agricultural, and land-use/land-cover data. My assessment was modest and confined to the scale of a single watershed but was motivated by the possibility of hacking agriculture with biophysical models that benefit business, the environment, and&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>Besides the data I already mentioned, there is also a wealth of aerial imagery and remote sensing data that can be used to refine a nitrogen flow model at a global scale. Modern tractors already have the technology to sample soil and terrain qualities in real-time. The opportunity lies in integrating all of this live data and producing models that can recommend or automate optimal fertilizer doses per square meter. This is the precision in precision&nbsp;agriculture.</p>
<p>As I hope to address this problem (among many others) in the near future, my current challenge is to dive into statistical/machine learning, distributed computing, and darker waters I am not even currently aware of. The plan is to emerge with enough technical chops to collaborate with a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers who can realize the potential of precision&nbsp;agriculture. </p>
<p>I created this blog with the intention of documenting my plunge. Just keep&nbsp;swimming.</p>
