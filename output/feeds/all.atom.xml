&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m living in a cottage in North Berkeley, drinking Kava, and willing myself to write this blog before next week&amp;#8217;s craziness&amp;nbsp;begins.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished my first week at Galvanize, which was all about getting us up to speed on programming. Unix commands, object oriented programming, data structures, and sorting&amp;nbsp;algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting tomorrow, the next eight weeks will entail two courses, each with a 3 hour daily&amp;nbsp;lab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematics for Data&amp;nbsp;Scientists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, and Statistics for Data&amp;nbsp;Scientists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A cool meta-learning tactic I adopted this&amp;nbsp;week:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spaced Repition Learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  is a really efficient way to engrain material into long-term memory. Learn something today, review immediately, and test yourself the next day. If you test successfully, increase the time interval between now and the next time you will remove/test. If you don&amp;#8217;t test successfully, set the time interval back to 0. Increasing the time interval makes your brain work harder to remember the material, which results in stronger neural wiring. I&amp;#8217;ve started using &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; to create and review flashcards in a system that implements &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have learned some &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; formatting techniques, I can focus on learning how to implement the LaTeX package on my blog so I can display python scripts and mathematical notation on the&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also going to a Flask workshop this Thursday, where I will learn how to deploy web apps with Python. All of this is going to lead to me displaying more &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; on this blog vs&amp;nbsp;journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sort my new life out more over time, I&amp;#8217;m looking for opportunities to volunteer in the civic analytics space. One organization that facilitates interesting collaborations between non-profits/governments and data scientists is &lt;a href="http://www.datakind.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DataKind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently they have an office at the Galvanize campus, so it should be pretty easy for me to get in&amp;nbsp;touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other cool things I did this&amp;nbsp;week:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to a slam poetry competition in Berkeley with this Australian lady I met on the train reading Joseph&amp;nbsp;Campbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Played tennis and got sushi with one of my classmates, who, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;surprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: went pro in Brazil when she was&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to a cognitive science reading group discussion on the religious&amp;nbsp;impulse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with some Neil Degrasse Tyson wisdom before I say&amp;nbsp;goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Maile and I had a chance to catch up and talk about math, machine learning, and education strategies, among other topics, while hiking the John Muir Trail. Maile and I have a history of doing long backpacking trips: we hiked 500 miles on the Colorado Trail after college graduation and met up to do the Teton Crest last summer. This time, we started south of Mt Whitney and hiked 230 miles to Yosemite over the course of 16 days (1 rest day at Vermillion Valley). Whereas the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; features many long stretches of ridge hiking at high elevation, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JMT&lt;/span&gt; is a procession of high mountain passes and low valleys. Gorgeous lakes and skinny-dipping were abundant. On our final day before finishing the trail in Yosemite, we woke up at 3:45 in the morning to make it to the top of Half-Dome to watch&amp;nbsp;sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabbing some burritos and beer, my uncle was kind enough to take us to Gilroy, where we were hosted by a friend and her awesome family. We managed to watch the new Star Trek movie, play Settlers of Catan on the beach, and enjoy a few $2 Bloody Marys before making our way to San Francisco, where we stayed with an old friend in her sweet Haight Ashbury&amp;nbsp;apartment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were in San Francisco, Maile and I checked out Metis and Galvanize, which both run data science programs in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOMA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into it, I was 80% sure I was going to enroll in Metis’ 12 week data science bootcamp. Besides being affordable and having a good curriculum with pedigreed instructors, I found the Metis culture to be really appealing. Several of the instructors and even the president reached out to me directly to answer my questions, share their stories, and give me feedback on my personal angle on data science (which is particularly spatial and environment focused). Meeting the staff and instructors in person further affirmed my sentiment. These are unpretentious people with a passion for education and&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galvanize was an entirely different animal. They have a 5-story campus the size of a city block across the street from LinkedIn’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt;. Besides being an educational facility with programs in Data Science and Web Development, the Galvanize campus is also a startup co-working/event space. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Google for Entrepreneurs, and Silicon Valley Bank also have offices within the complex. Galvanize runs a 12 week data science bootcamp, but I was more interested in their year long Masters program, which is accredited by the University of New Haven. Here were the major takeaways after speaking with the director, Nir&amp;nbsp;Kaldero…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNH&lt;/span&gt; is pretty hands off. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNH&lt;/span&gt; administrates and hires professors with experience in academia and industry. The professors and Galvanize are given full reign to revamp and revise their curriculum to keep pace with the hiring needs of the tech giants. 
Galvanize’s Masters program goes way deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed computing than any other program I’ve seen while being broad enough to produce flexible, adaptable, and job-ready data scientists. 
Galvanize has a litany of industry partners that are begging to give you a summer internship. As a Masters candidate, you produce your final practicum project during your summer internship. There&amp;#8217;s a pitch day in which companies come to campus and present projects/problems they need help with. From there, you choose who you want to work with and are mentored by a Galvanize instructor while you carry out your internship. Nir said 100% of past graduates have had jobs lined up before they graduated.
Once your in Galvanize, you are surrounded by elite, high-caliber, motivated, independent thinkers and doers. The vibe is much more intimidating than Metis, but the goal isn’t to feel comfortable, the goal is&amp;nbsp;growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it must be obvious by now that I decided to go with Galvanize-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNH&lt;/span&gt;. It was really helpful to go through all of this with Maile, who is also an aspiring data scientist. After talking about our impressions at length, our conclusion was that Galvanize’s program provides the best chance for us to fulfill our highest, most ambitious&amp;nbsp;aspirations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt; episode, we flew out to Seattle and met up with some other college friends. We checked out General Assembly and a lecture at Galvanize’s Seattle campus. It was also fun to eat a ton of seafood, run around Discovery Park, see my cousin for the first time in 18 years, swim in the Sound, and walk out to the Dungenees lighthouse. At the end of the trip, I took some much needed solo time in the Portland&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m back in Colorado for two weeks before I move to Berkeley! I got really lucky with housing: one of my best friends from college has a family friend with a small cottage in North Berkeley who is willing to rent it out to me for a very affordable rate. I’m currently working on some pre-course work for Galvanize, which I may cover in greater detail in another post. I also have a lot work to do on the appearance of this blog. Looks kind of cartoonish as of the&amp;nbsp;moment&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of done talking about myself for now &amp;#8212;- ready to buckle&amp;nbsp;down!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Finally Launching</title><link href="http://terrabytesincognita.com/finally-launching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T13:21:00-07:00</published><author><name>Anthony Abercrombie</name></author><id>tag:terrabytesincognita.com,2016-07-01:finally-launching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I promised myself I would launch this blog before I left for my big trip, so here it&amp;nbsp;is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this trip I speak of, and what does it have to do with Terra[bytes]&amp;nbsp;Incognita?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning I&amp;#8217;m flying to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, where I&amp;#8217;m meeting up with a good friend of mine to hike the John Muir trail. We will be entering through the southern portal by Mt. Whitney and will conclude the trek in Yosemite. Super&amp;nbsp;stoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thats only half of&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also be checking out a few Data Science programs in San Francisco and Seattle. Berkley, Galvanize, Metis, and General Assembly are all on the&amp;nbsp;list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be writing reviews of each program after I go there in person and pick up some&amp;nbsp;vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be travelling for the full month of July, so I&amp;#8217;ll get you caught up after I return to Colorado in August. I look forward to sharing more on the web in the near&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Precision Agriculture</title><link href="http://terrabytesincognita.com/precision-agriculture.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T10:35:00-07:00</published><author><name>Anthony Abercrombie</name></author><id>tag:terrabytesincognita.com,2016-07-01:precision-agriculture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Precision agriculture, like most business prerogatives, is concerned with minimizing inputs while maximizing outputs. One high-cost input in agriculture is fertilizer, which has financial and environmental costs; not to mention an $82 million dollar per year cost to the seafood and tourism&amp;nbsp;industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypoxic dead zone off the gulf-coast, devoid of any aquatic life, is attributed to a lack of oxygen due to the proliferation of algal blooms, which dominate in a nitrogen rich environment fueled by excess&amp;nbsp;fertilizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To optimize and ensure crop yields, farmers hedge their bets by applying fertilizer to an extent to which all the biomass between the farm and the lake/river cannot fully absorb the runaway&amp;nbsp;nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascading excess nitrogen poses an opportunity for farmers to “piggyback” off of upstream nitrogen and spend less money on fertilizer. However, farmers have their livelihood at stake and cannot afford to make uneducated guesses as to where they can skim on&amp;nbsp;fertilizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where machine learning comes into play. For my college thesis, I worked on a hydrological model called Soil and Water Assessment Tool (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWAT&lt;/span&gt;) in an ArcGIS environment to identify critical “sinks” and “sources” of accumulated nitrogen using topographic, geological, climate, agricultural, and land-use/land-cover data. My assessment was modest and confined to the scale of a single watershed but was motivated by the possibility of hacking agriculture with biophysical models that benefit business, the environment, and&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the data I already mentioned, there is also a wealth of aerial imagery and remote sensing data that can be used to refine a nitrogen flow model at a global scale. Modern tractors already have the technology to sample soil and terrain qualities in real-time. The opportunity lies in integrating all of this live data and producing models that can recommend or automate optimal fertilizer doses per square meter. This is the precision in precision&amp;nbsp;agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I hope to address this problem (among many others) in the near future, my current challenge is to dive into statistical/machine learning, distributed computing, and darker waters I am not even currently aware of. The plan is to emerge with enough technical chops to collaborate with a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers who can realize the potential of precision&amp;nbsp;agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created this blog with the intention of documenting my plunge. Just keep&amp;nbsp;swimming.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>About Terra[bytes] Incognita</title><link href="http://terrabytesincognita.com/about-terrabytes-incognita.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T10:10:00-07:00</published><author><name>Anthony Abercrombie</name></author><id>tag:terrabytesincognita.com,2016-07-01:about-terrabytes-incognita.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The passion behind Terra[bytes] Incognita lies is at the intersection of data science and geospatial&amp;nbsp;analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Anthony Abercrombie and I come from an environmental science background. I&amp;#8217;m interested in solving business, social, and environmental problems by leveraging data in all&amp;nbsp;formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, I have been prone to spend hours staring at maps. I enjoy logistics and planning my excursions as a backpacker, skier, and mountain&amp;nbsp;biker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 6 months I have committed myself to learning &amp;#8220;data science.&amp;#8221; This field entices my rabid intellectual curiousity and involves some really powerful analytical tools that will probably transform our&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog will document my continuing learning process and serve as a hub for personal projects and musings on data science and civic&amp;nbsp;analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created this site using Pelican, which makes great use of Python. The site is hosted on Amazon S3, which is dirt cheap for static&amp;nbsp;websites.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
