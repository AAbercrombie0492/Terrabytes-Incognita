summary: Report on the July trek and what's next.

July 2016 was pretty awesome…. 

My friend Maile and I had a chance to catch up and talk about math, machine learning, and education strategies, among other topics, while hiking the John Muir Trail. Maile and I have a history of doing long backpacking trips: we hiked 500 miles on the Colorado Trail after college graduation and met up to do the Teton Crest last summer. This time, we started south of Mt Whitney and hiked 230 miles to Yosemite over the course of 16 days (1 rest day at Vermillion Valley). Whereas the CT features many long stretches of ridge hiking at high elevation, the JMT is a procession of high mountain passes and low valleys. Gorgeous lakes and skinny-dipping were abundant. On our final day before finishing the trail in Yosemite, we woke up at 3:45 in the morning to make it to the top of Half-Dome to watch sunrise. 

After grabbing some burritos and beer, my uncle was kind enough to take us to Gilroy, where we were hosted by a friend and her awesome family. We managed to watch the new Star Trek movie, play Settlers of Catan on the beach, and enjoy a few $2 Bloody Marys before making our way to San Francisco, where we stayed with an old friend in her sweet Haight Ashbury apartment. 

While we were in San Francisco, Maile and I checked out Metis and Galvanize, which both run data science programs in SOMA.

Going into it, I was 80% sure I was going to enroll in Metis’ 12 week data science bootcamp. Besides being affordable and having a good curriculum with pedigreed instructors, I found the Metis culture to be really appealing. Several of the instructors and even the president reached out to me directly to answer my questions, share their stories, and give me feedback on my personal angle on data science (which is particularly spatial and environment focused). Meeting the staff and instructors in person further affirmed my sentiment. These are unpretentious people with a passion for education and data. 

Galvanize was an entirely different animal. They have a 5-story campus the size of a city block across the street from LinkedIn’s HQ. Besides being an educational facility with programs in Data Science and Web Development, the Galvanize campus is also a startup co-working/event space. IBM, Google for Entrepreneurs, and Silicon Valley Bank also have offices within the complex. Galvanize runs a 12 week data science bootcamp, but I was more interested in their year long Masters program, which is accredited by the University of New Haven. Here were the major takeaways after speaking with the director, Nir Kaldero…

UNH is pretty hands off. UNH administrates and hires professors with experience in academia and industry. The professors and Galvanize are given full reign to revamp and revise their curriculum to keep pace with the hiring needs of the tech giants. 
Galvanize’s Masters program goes way deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed computing than any other program I’ve seen while being broad enough to produce flexible, adaptable, and job-ready data scientists. 
Galvanize has a litany of industry partners that are begging to give you a summer internship. As a Masters candidate, you produce your final practicum project during your summer internship. There's a pitch day in which companies come to campus and present projects/problems they need help with. From there, you choose who you want to work with and are mentored by a Galvanize instructor while you carry out your internship. Nir said 100% of past graduates have had jobs lined up before they graduated.
Once your in Galvanize, you are surrounded by elite, high-caliber, motivated, independent thinkers and doers. The vibe is much more intimidating than Metis, but the goal isn’t to feel comfortable, the goal is growth.

That being said, it must be obvious by now that I decided to go with Galvanize-UNH. It was really helpful to go through all of this with Maile, who is also an aspiring data scientist. After talking about our impressions at length, our conclusion was that Galvanize’s program provides the best chance for us to fulfill our highest, most ambitious aspirations. 

After the SF episode, we flew out to Seattle and met up with some other college friends. We checked out General Assembly and a lecture at Galvanize’s Seattle campus. It was also fun to eat a ton of seafood, run around Discovery Park, see my cousin for the first time in 18 years, swim in the Sound, and walk out to the Dungenees lighthouse. At the end of the trip, I took some much needed solo time in the Portland area.

Now I’m back in Colorado for two weeks before I move to Berkeley! I got really lucky with housing: one of my best friends from college has a family friend with a small cottage in North Berkeley who is willing to rent it out to me for a very affordable rate. I’m currently working on some pre-course work for Galvanize, which I may cover in greater detail in another post. I also have a lot work to do on the appearance of this blog. Looks kind of cartoonish as of the moment...

Kind of done talking about myself for now --- ready to buckle down!
