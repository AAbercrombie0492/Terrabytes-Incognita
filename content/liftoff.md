summary: What's Anthony up to?

I promised myself I would launch this blog before I left for my big trip, so here it is!

So what is this trip I speak of, and what does it have to do with Terra[bytes] Incognita?

Tomorrow morning I'm flying to LA, where I'm meeting up with a good friend of mine to hike the John Muir trail. We will be entering through the southern portal by Mt. Whitney and will conclude the trek in Yosemite. Super stoked.

But thats only half of it...

I'll also be checking out a few Data Science programs in San Francisco and Seattle. Berkley, Galvanize, Metis, and General Assembly are all on the list. 

I'll be writing reviews of each program after I go there in person and pick up some vibes.

I will be travelling for the full month of July, so I'll get you caught up after I return to Colorado in August. I look forward to sharing more on the web in the near future.

Anthony
