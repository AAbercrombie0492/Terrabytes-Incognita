summary: Python Bootcamp and First Week in the Bay Area

It's been 3 weeks since I published my [last post](http://terrabytesincognita.com/big-decisions.html), in which I debriefed on my July adventure and announced my plans to link up with [Galvanize in San Francisco](http://www.galvanizeu.com/practicum).

Now I'm living in a cottage in North Berkeley, drinking Kava, and willing myself to write this blog before next week's craziness begins.   

I just finished my first week at Galvanize, which was all about getting us up to speed on programming. Unix commands, object oriented programming, data structures, and sorting algorithms. 

Starting tomorrow, the next eight weeks will entail two courses, each with a 3 hour daily lab:

  - **Mathematics for Data Scientists**
  - **Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, and Statistics for Data
Scientists**


#### A cool meta-learning tactic I adopted this week:

[_Spaced Repition Learning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)  is a really efficient way to engrain material into long-term memory. Learn something today, review immediately, and test yourself the next day. If you test successfully, increase the time interval between now and the next time you will remove/test. If you don't test successfully, set the time interval back to 0. Increasing the time interval makes your brain work harder to remember the material, which results in stronger neural wiring. I've started using [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) to create and review flashcards in a system that implements SRL.

Now that I have learned some __Markdown__ formatting techniques, I can focus on learning how to implement the LaTeX package on my blog so I can display python scripts and mathematical notation on the web.

I'm also going to a Flask workshop this Thursday, where I will learn how to deploy web apps with Python. All of this is going to lead to me displaying more **content** on this blog vs journaling.

As I sort my new life out more over time, I'm looking for opportunities to volunteer in the civic analytics space. One organization that facilitates interesting collaborations between non-profits/governments and data scientists is [__DataKind__](http://www.datakind.org/). Apparently they have an office at the Galvanize campus, so it should be pretty easy for me to get in touch.

#### Other cool things I did this week:
  - Went to a slam poetry competition in Berkeley with this Australian lady I met on the train reading Joseph Campbell. 

  - Played tennis and got sushi with one of my classmates, who, **__surprise__**: went pro in Brazil when she was 16.

  - Went to a cognitive science reading group discussion on the religious impulse. 

I'll leave you with some Neil Degrasse Tyson wisdom before I say goodnight.
