summary: What this site is about...

The passion behind Terra[bytes] Incognita lies is at the intersection of data science and geospatial analysis. 

My name is Anthony Abercrombie and I come from an environmental science background. I'm interested in solving business, social, and environmental problems by leveraging data in all formats. 

For as long as I can remember, I have been prone to spend hours staring at maps. I enjoy logistics and planning my excursions as a backpacker, skier, and mountain biker.

For the last 6 months I have committed myself to learning "data science." This field entices my rabid intellectual curiousity and involves some really powerful analytical tools that will probably transform our society.

This blog will document my continuing learning process and serve as a hub for personal projects and musings on data science and civic analytics.

I created this site using Pelican, which makes great use of Python. The site is hosted on Amazon S3, which is dirt cheap for static websites.
